# Item 28 do Prospero

We plan to conduct a descriptive synthesis of the findings (extracting author names, sample size, instruments, measure of effect, study aim, and others informations listed in item 26 of the form).
In order to summarize the results of the selected articles for the review, a meta-analysis will be performed.
The meta-analysis type is Aggregate Data Meta-Analysis. The meta-analysis method will depend on the measures of effect of the articles, varying for dichotomous, continuous or ordinal data, counts or rates of the outcome, etc.
When measuring statistical heterogeneity, we will use I2 (I-squared). It is defined as the percentage of variability in the effect sizes that is not caused by sampling error.
The software package to be used for meta-analysis is R (version 4.1.0) with the package meta
(version 4.18).
